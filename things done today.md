okay i want us to now buld this thing to completion for now , so i need you to do this , 

well first i have gone through the cod api and i have realised that one cannot automatilcaly create a match and the players have to be the hosts , well one of them , so i want you to go through the cod api and fisnish building this to completion once and for all , also go to the mpesa documentation and finish this once and for all , also for the verification part i want the number to be mandatory since the mpesa number is important in this as the deposits will be made via mpesa right ? so make it so tha the mpesa number is crucial okay , so start this now , and also i want the matchmaking and tournament logic to be like the one in thie website : https://www.checkmategaming.com/

and make this as good as possible okay

Of course, I will help you build your project to completion. This is a significant undertaking, so I will break it down into smaller, manageable phases.

Here is the plan:

Project Scaffolding and User Model: I will start by modifying the user model to make the M-Pesa phone number a mandatory field for registration and verification.
M-Pesa Integration: Next, I will integrate the M-Pesa API for handling deposits.
Call of Duty API Integration: I will then work on the COD API integration for match-related functionalities.
Matchmaking and Tournaments: Finally, I will implement the core matchmaking and tournament logic, using checkmategaming.com as a reference.
I will start by exploring the existing codebase to understand its structure. I'll begin by listing all the files in the backend directory.

Thank you for providing the file structure. Based on that, I've identified the key files for our first step: making the M-Pesa number mandatory.

I'll now examine app/models/user.py and app/schemas/user.py to understand the current user data structure before making any changes. I'll start with app/models/user.py.

Analyzed
user.py:(1-200)

Okay, I see the User model in app/models/user.py already has phone as a required field (nullable=False).

Now, I'll inspect the corresponding Pydantic schema in app/schemas/user.py to ensure the phone number is a mandatory field during user creation and updates. This will enforce the requirement at the API level. After that, I will proceed with the necessary changes.

Thought Process






Great, the phone_verified field has been added to the User model. Now, I'll update the app/schemas/user.py file to include this new field in the Pydantic schemas. This ensures the phone_verified status is communicated through the API.

I will add phone_verified to the UserBase schema, which will propagate it to the other user-related schemas.

Now that I've updated the User model and schemas, the next step is to apply these changes to the database. I will use alembic to create a new migration file that will add the phone_verified column to the users table. After that, I will apply the migration to update the database schema.

First, I'll generate the migration script.

Debugging Migration Errors

I'm currently investigating the "sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchModuleError" stemming from Alembic migration attempts. This is concerning, as the error points to a potential issue with dialect loading. I suspect it may be related to an environment mismatch or a misconfigured database driver. I'm scrutinizing my project's dependencies and configuration files for discrepancies.

Troubleshooting Connection Strings

I'm now focusing on the database URL within alembic.ini. The traceback pointed me to run_migrations_online() and engine_from_config(). I believe the missing or incorrect dialect in the URL, such as postgresql://..., is causing NoSuchModuleError. I'm verifying the connection string's format and ensuring the driver, like psycopg2, is correctly specified and installed. I plan to check the alembic.ini and any related environment variables.

Inspecting Configuration Files

I'm now diving deeper into the configuration files to pinpoint the source of the NoSuchModuleError. I've started with alembic.ini to examine the sqlalchemy.url setting. Then, I'll move on to alembic/env.py, app/core/config.py, and requirements.txt. My main focus is on the database URL and the presence of the correct driver specification, e.g., postgresql+psycopg2://....

It seems like you've run into an issue with your database configuration, which is preventing alembic from generating the migration. The error sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchModuleError: Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:driver indicates that the database driver is either missing from your connection URL or not installed in your environment.

To resolve this, I need to inspect your configuration. I'll start by examining alembic.ini to see how the sqlalchemy.url is defined.

Analyzed
alembic.ini:(1-200)
The alembic.ini file shows that the sqlalchemy.url is set to the placeholder driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname. This is the root of the problem. The application isn't loading the actual database URL from the environment variables.

To fix this, I will modify alembic/env.py to load the database URL from the app.core.config.settings module, which correctly loads the application's configuration, including the database URL from your .env file. This will ensure that alembic uses the same database connection as the main application.

Now that I've configured alembic to use the correct database URL, I can proceed with generating the database migration script. This will create a new file in the alembic/versions directory containing the necessary SQL to add the phone_verified column to your users table.

I'll now rerun the alembic revision command.

I have identified the Tournament and TournamentParticipant models in app/models/tournament.py. I will now inspect the final model file, app/models/transaction.py, to complete the list of models. After this, I will have all the information needed to fix the alembic migration issue.

Next, I'll examine app/models/transaction.py.

Analyzed
transaction.py:(1-200)

I have now identified all the models in your application. The final step before we can fix the migration issue is to import all of these models into the app/models/init.py file. This will allow alembic to correctly detect your database schema and generate the correct migration.

I will now update the app/models/init.py file with the necessary imports. After that, I will run the alembic revision and alembic upgrade commands again. This should resolve the migration issue and get your database schema up to date.

I will start by updating the app/models/init.py file.

Great, the database migration was successful and the phone_verifications table has been created.

Now, I will create the Pydantic schemas for the phone verification process in a new file, app/schemas/phone_verification.py. These schemas will be used for data validation in the API endpoints.

Now that the configuration is complete, I will create a new mpesa.py service to handle the logic for initiating M-Pesa STK push requests. This service will use the mpesa library and the credentials you've provided to trigger a payment prompt on the user's phone.

I will start by creating the app/services/mpesa.py file and adding the necessary code to initialize the M-Pesa client and handle STK push requests. After this, I will proceed to update the payments service and implement the API endpoints.

With the mpesa service in place, I'll now update the payments service to integrate with it. The process_deposit function will be modified to create a pending transaction and initiate an M-Pesa STK push instead of directly updating the user's wallet. I'll also add a function to handle the M-Pesa callback and update the transaction status accordingly.

First, I need to see the current content of app/services/payments.py.

First, I'll view the app/api/routes/matches.py file to see its current structure.

I've reviewed the matches router. I will now add the endpoints for confirming a match and reporting the result. I'll also define a new ReportResultRequest schema for the request body of the result reporting endpoint.

I will now modify app/api/routes/matches.py to add these new features.

I have successfully implemented the match confirmation and result reporting features. Now, I will proceed with creating a matchmaking system that automatically pairs players for matches.

This system will consist of:

A matchmaking queue where players can register to find a match.
A matchmaking service that periodically scans the queue and creates matches between suitable players.
API endpoints for players to join or leave the queue.
I'll start by creating the database model for the matchmaking queue. This will require a new file, app/models/matchmaking_queue.py, to define the table structure. The table will store the user's ID, the type of game they want to play, and their status in the queue.

I will now create the app/models/matchmaking_queue.py file.

I've created the MatchmakingQueue model. To ensure it's included in our database migrations, I need to import it in app/models/__init__.py.

I'll view the __init__.py file first to see its contents.
